## Differentiable Learning of Logical Rules for Knowledge Base Reasoning
- Task: Infering relations in the knowledge base (KB completion).
- Problem: The intuition behind is, if R_k are relations, then 
    R_n(Y, Z_n) and ... and R_1(Z_1, X)	 infers R(Y, X). 
    In other words, if a certain path of relations exists between (Y, X), 
    then a certain relation between them is infered. 
- Method: given
